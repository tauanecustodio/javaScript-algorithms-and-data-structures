1. 🔺[Pyramid generator](01-pyramid-generator)
> In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Pyramid Generator. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
2. 🎒 [Gradebook app](02-gradebook-app)
> In this mini project, you will get to review JavaScript fundamentals like functions, variables, conditionals and more by building a gradebook app.
  
> This will give you an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.
3. 🕹️ [Role playing game](03-role-playing-game)
> In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
4. 🔵 [Random background](04-random-background)
> In this project, you will help CamperBot build a random background color changer and help them find and fix errors.
5. ⚖️ [Calorie counter](05-calorie-counter)
> In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results. 

>In this practice project, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
6. 👋🏻 [Rock, paper, scissors game](06-rock-paper-scissors/)
>In this mini project, you will review conditionals, functions, getElementById, and more. This project will give you an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.
7. 🎵 [Music Player](07-music-player)
>Now let's learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

>In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.
8. 🔤 [Palindrome Checker](09-palindrome-checker)
>This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.  

>For this project, you'll build an application that checks whether a given word is a palindrome.

9. 🗓️ [Date formatter](08-date-formatter)
>In this project, you'll learn how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. You'll also learn how to correctly format dates.  


>This project will cover concepts such as the `getDate()`, `getMonth()`, and `getFullYear()` methods.

10. ⚽ [Football Team Cards](10-football-team-cards)
> One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

> This project will cover concepts like, default parameters, `Object.freeze()`, and reinforce your knowledge of the `switch` statement and `map()` method.
11. ✅ [Todo app](11-todo-app/)
> Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

> In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.
